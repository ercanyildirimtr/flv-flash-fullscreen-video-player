### Requirements ###
The FLV Flash Fullscreen Video Player can be used stand-alone, you don’t need Flash (= the authoring tool).

It’s very simple: The Player uses parameters attached to the URL (e.g. flashvideoplayer.html?video=demo.flv). Just upload the player files to your web server and create a link to the player that contains the parameters.

You can also embed the player using an iFrame or SWFObject.

Client: Any version of the Flash Player 9 is required. Release 9.0.115. or higher for H.264 videos.
